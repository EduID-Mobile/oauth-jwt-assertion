# Assertion Structure

```
{
    sub : username (authentication phase) or ID (authorization phase)
    iss : registered client (authentication phase) or device instance (authorization phase)
    aud : AP Token endpoint
    azp (+ cnf.jwk): instance uuid (device id). becomes iss (authentication phase)
    azp (+ cnf.kid): redirect_uri of the academic service (authorization phase)
    iat : timestamp when the assertion has been created.
    exp : timestamp until when the assertion is valid (e.g. iat + 5 min.)
    cnf : public confirmation key (cnf.jwk, authentication phase)/confirmation key reference (cnf.kid, authorization phase)
    x_crd : credentials (e.g. password)
    x_jwt : access token issued by AP to the assertion issuer (optional)
}
```

All assertions are encrypted for the AP (that is this service).

During the authentication phase the Trust Agent App needs to register its device (via the azp claim)

# 1.1 Request

[-] 1.1.1 RFC 6749: The RP MUST forward the request as POST to the AP.

[-] 1.1.2 The RP MUST forward all incoming parameters to the AP.

[-] 1.1.3 The RP MUST add a scope parameter according to the required information from the AP.

[-] 1.1.4 If the incoming request already has a scope parameter then the RP MUST extend it to match its requirements.

[x] 1.1.5 RFC 7523: The grant type MUST be urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer

[x] 1.1.6 RFC 7521: The token endpoint MUST accept the assertion parameter.

[-] 1.1.7 The RP MUST identify the AP either via unique redirection URLs OR via the AP's public key used for encrypting the assertion.

[-] 1.1.8 The RP SHOULD reject any assertion that exposes an unknown kid in the assertion's header.

[-] 1.1.9 The RP MUST reject any assertion if the AP cannot be identified.

[ ] 1.1.10 RPs MUST accept the assertion grant_types for OAuth2 endpoints without client authentication.

[ ] 1.1.11 RPs MUST identify the AP through the aud claim of the assertion

[ ] 1.1.12 RPs MUST reject assertions to unknown AP.

[ ] 1.1.13 RPs MAY register to unknown APs that allow dynamic client registration prior of validating the assertion.


- LDAP -> assertion client registeration in a special section for Client-Instances
- Client Instances ONLY allow grant_type urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer
- Client Instances MUST have a user reference for sub validation
- LDAP -> Client Instances MUST have a user reference as DN

[x] 3.1.10 The assertions payload MUST contain an azp.

[ ] 3.1.11 If azp is present and the client ID not equals the assertion's issuer claim, then the azp MUST match one of the client's redirect URIs.

[ ] 3.1.12 If the client ID matches the assertion's issuer claim and an azp claim is present, then the client MUST be registered for proxy_authorization.

[ ] 3.1.13 proxy_authorization SHOULD be granted only to trust agents.

# 3.2 validate JWT

[x] 3.2.1 The assertion MUST be signed by the TA.

[x] 3.2.2 If the cnf claim holds a JWK, the assertion MUST be signed using the TA's client key.
